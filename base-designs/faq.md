1) Do I get to approve the visuals before being posted?
Yes, you retain full creative control with key check-ins for approval throughout the production process. 

2) How much input do I have in the multimedia creation process?
The creative process is deeply collaborative from start to finish. We begin by working with you to identify which scenes deserve visuals and gathering your vision for character appearances, settings, and pivotal moments. Depending on how involved you want to be, you could even provide creative briefs and reference materials, to help us understand your vision more clearly.

3) What if I don't like something that's been created?
Capturing your vision is our top priority. If something isn't right, we'll revise it until it matches what you imagined. 


4) Who owns the rights to the multimedia content created?

Think of it like a Netflix adaptation: if Netflix turns your book into a TV series, you still own your original story and characters, but Netflix owns the specific show they produced. You couldn't take their filmed episodes to another platform, but you still own your underlying book and could license it elsewhere.

Similarly, Mythic Novel retains ownership of all multimedia content we create (videos, images, character art, maps, etc.). Since we invest our resources to produce this content at no upfront cost to you, it remains our intellectual property, so we need it to stay on our platform. You always retain full ownership of your original story, text, and characters—we're simply creating visual interpretations of your work.


5) Can I use the multimedia content for my own marketing?

Absolutely! We encourage you to share multimedia content on your social media, website, and other promotional channels. We'll provide you with a selection of downloadable assets like key character art, compelling scene visuals, and video teasers, all specifically optimized for sharing across different platforms.

While not every single visual will be available for download (to preserve the full experience for readers on our platform), you'll have plenty of stunning content to generate excitement and drive readers to your novel on Mythic Novel.The only requirement is that they're used for promotional purposes that benefit both your novel and the Mythic Novel platform.



6) What happens to the multimedia content if I leave the platform?

If you choose to leave Mythic Novel, your novel and all associated multimedia content will be taken down from the platform. You of course retain full rights to your original story and text, but the visual enhancements we created (videos, images, character art, maps) remain our property and cannot be used outside of Mythic Novel.


7) Is this an exclusive arrangement?

No, you're free to sell your original novel anywhere you'd like including Amazon, your website, or other platforms with no restrictions. Choosing to have your novel adapted on Mythic Novel doesn't limit where else you can publish or sell your text-only version.

The multimedia-enhanced version of your novel (with videos, images, and interactive elements) will be exclusive to Mythic Novel, but your original text can be available everywhere. Think of it as having two versions of your work: your traditional novel that you can sell anywhere, and a special multimedia edition that readers can only experience on our platform.


8) What is the financial model?
Readers pay $12/month for unlimited access to all novels on our platform. Authors earn through our transparent revenue-share model with no upfront costs.
We offer competitive revenue sharing that rewards both organic discovery and authors who bring their own readership. Our Direct Author Pool system ensures your earnings are based on actual reader engagement. When a reader pays their subscription, their payment only goes to the authors they actually read that month, not spread thin across a diluted platform-wide pool. You earn directly from your actual readers.
Authors who bring readers to the platform through their invite links earn additional lifetime commissions on those readers.
Note: Detailed compensation structure will be provided upon acceptance into the program.

9) Can my fans subscribe directly to me instead of the site-wide subscription?
Readers subscribe to the full Mythic Novel platform, but your dedicated fans directly impact your earnings. The more exclusively a reader engages with your work, the larger your share of their subscription becomes.


10) When and how do I get paid?
You're paid monthly, with payments processed around the 10th of each month for the previous month's earnings.
Payments are sent directly to your bank account through our secure payment partner, Stripe. When you first join Mythic Novel, you'll complete a quick setup to connect your bank account—it takes just a few minutes. Stripe handles all tax documentation automatically, including 1099s for US authors.
We maintain a minimum payout threshold to ensure transaction fees don't eat into smaller payments. Details will be provided upon acceptance.
You'll be able to track your earnings and payment history through your author dashboard, so you always know exactly what you've earned and when to expect payment.


11) Can I see analytics on my readership and earnings?
Yes, you'll have access to a comprehensive analytics dashboard that shows exactly how readers are engaging with your work. This includes metrics like total reads, reading completion rates, which chapters readers love most, and where they typically stop reading—all updated in real-time.
For earnings, you'll see your estimated monthly revenue, which becomes final after each month ends (once we calculate the Direct Author Pool distribution based on all reader activity). You'll also have access to your complete payment history and can track which novels are generating the most engagement.
