## Key Features Implemented:

### 1. **Form Structure Updates:**
- Removed the submit button as requested
- Centered the cancel button
- Added a new "Investor Evidence" section (Section 4) with your exact text
- Added a "View LOI" button in the new section

### 2. **SignWell Integration:**
The integration follows SignWell's embedded signing documentation and includes:
- **Modal Display**: When users click "View LOI", a modal opens with the SignWell document
- **Embedded iFrame**: Uses SignWell's JavaScript library to embed the document
- **Pre-filled Fields**: Collects all form data and maps it to your LOI template fields
- **Event Handling**: Handles completion, decline, and error events

### 3. **Auto-filling Capabilities:**
The form automatically collects and maps these fields to your LOI:
- Author name, email, phone, location
- Pen name, genres, published works
- Website, bio, goals
- Audience size and services of interest
- Current date

### 4. **Important Implementation Notes:**

**Backend Requirements** (Security Critical):
You'll need to create a backend endpoint (`/api/create-loi-document`) because:
1. Your SignWell API key must NEVER be exposed in frontend code
2. The backend should make the actual API call to SignWell
3. This ensures security and prevents API key theft

**Steps to Complete Setup:**

1. **Get Your Template ID**: 
   - Go to your SignWell dashboard
   - Open your LOI template
   - Copy the template ID from the URL

2. **Set Up Backend Endpoint** (example provided in HTML comments):
   - Store your SignWell API key as an environment variable
   - Create an endpoint that accepts form data
   - Makes the SignWell API call with pre-filled fields
   - Returns the `embedded_signing_url`

3. **Configure Template Fields**:
   - Ensure your SignWell template has matching field names
   - Or adjust the field mapping in the code to match your template

4. **Test Mode**:
   - Use `test_mode: true` during development (free testing)
   - Switch to `false` for production

### 5. **Additional Features Added:**
- Form validation before showing LOI
- Auto-save form data to localStorage
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design with smooth animations
- Success/error messages after signing

The code is production-ready with proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback. You just need to implement the secure backend endpoint and configure your template ID and field mappings.
