What genres will be available at launch?
We'll be launching with a strong focus on Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and LitRPG, with plans to expand into other genres such as Thriller, Mystery, and Romance soon after.
Will this work on my tablet and phone?
Yes! Our platform works across all your devices. Use any modern browser on desktop, or download our dedicated app (coming soon) for any mobile device or tablet for an optimized reading experience.
How much will it cost?
We are still finalizing our pricing structure. Join the waitlist to be the first to know and to receive an exclusive early-adopter discount.
Will I be able to read offline?
We know how important offline reading is for travel and commuting. While our initial launch will require an internet connection to experience the full multimedia content, an offline reading mode is a high-priority feature on our development roadmap.
How often will new books and chapters be added?
Our library will grow continuously! We are constantly partnering with new authors and will be adding new novels and serialized chapters on a regular basis. Our goal is to ensure there is always a fresh, high-quality story waiting for you to discover.
Is this a subscription service, or do I buy books individually?
We are building a subscription-based service, and we're fine-tuning the details to offer maximum choice.
